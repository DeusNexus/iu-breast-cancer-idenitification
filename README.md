### Model Engineering (DLBDSME01) - **Task 1: Development of an Interpretable Model for Breast Cancer Prediction**

Abstract: 
....

### Purpose
According to the breast cancer is one of the most common cancer types overall. Diagnosing a breast pathology in time is very important since it significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. Thus, a fast and accurate classification of a tumor as benign or malignant is important. Moreover, to increase technology acceptance, the trustworthiness of the approach is critical.

A group of oncologists have seen impressive breast cancer identification results from an AI algorithm on a fair. However, the group did not understand why the model predicted certain tumors as malign and others as benign - the validity of the model was questioned in some cases. The group also discussed the most important features for the predictions. Finally, they decided to ask a group of data scientists, you are one of them, for possibilities to understand the prediction of a possible machine learning model. Your task is to develop a classification model that predicts a tumor to be malignant or benign with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.95). Moreover, the model should be interpretable. The outcomes should be presented/communicated to non-experts to convince them about the trustworthiness of the chosen approach.

### Task
`Support a group of oncologists with the interpretable prediction model to allow for additional indications that can be produced automatically as well as support understanding to ease technology acceptance.`

# Project Organization
`Organize the project using the CRISP-DM or the MS Team Data Science method. Make a proposal on how to build the folder structure of a Git repository for the project.`

# Dataset Quality Evaluation
`Assess the quality of the data set provided. Prepare and visualize your findings in such a way that business partners can understand the important relationships in a clear and simple way.`

# Candidate Models
`Establish a collection of candidate models that meets the requirements and investigate feature importance on different models. (Tip: consider the interpretability of the models and increase complexity gradually. The accuracy should be high, but the interpretability of the model is the final aim.)`
- Model Training
- Model Evalations
- Best Model

## Interpretability
`Make the model results as interpretable as possible.`

## Importance of Explanatory Variables
`To help business partners develop confidence in your new model, discuss the importance of each explanatory variable.`

## Detailed Error Analysis
`A detailed error analysis is very important so that the business partners also understand the weaknesses of your approach.`

# Making the Model Accessible for Operations
`In the last step of the project, propose how your model can be integrated into the daily work of the doctors, for example how a graphical user interface (GUI) could look like.`

*** At the end of each step of this use case, you should critically assess whether all necessary operations have been conducted and argue for the decisions you have made during this process. ***
