Explore Dataset:
[] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
- [] Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset, 
- [] examining statistical summaries, 
- [] distributions, 
- [] and relationships between variables.
[] **Data Cleaning**: 
- [] Check for missing values, 
- [] outliers, and inconsistencies. 
- [] Clearly document any data cleaning steps taken.
[] **Visualizations**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate key relationships and patterns within the data, ensuring business partners can understand important aspects easily.

Candidate Models:
`Establish a collection of candidate models considering the task requirements. Focus on increasing complexity gradually while prioritizing interpretability. Key steps include:`
[] **Model Training**: 
- [] Train multiple models with varying complexities (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods). 
- [] Document the training process and hyperparameter choices.
[] **Model Evaluations**: 
- [] Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics, 
- [] ensuring high accuracy (F1 score > 0.95). 
- [] Provide detailed explanations of the evaluation results.
[] **Best Model**: Select the best-performing model based on the 
- [] evaluation metrics and 
- [] feature importance analysis.

[] **Interpretability** - Ensure the developed model is interpretable:
- [] Utilize models with inherent interpretability, such as decision trees or linear models.
- [] Provide clear explanations of the model's decision-making process.
- [] Use visualizations to illustrate important aspects of the model's behavior.

[] **Importance of Explanatory Variables** - Discuss the importance of each explanatory variable:
- [] Conduct feature importance analysis to identify variables contributing significantly to model predictions.
- [] Clearly communicate the relevance of each variable in the context of breast cancer prediction.

[] **Detailed Error Analysis** - Perform a detailed error analysis to understand the weaknesses of the approach:
- [] Identify common types of errors made by the model (e.g., false positives, false negatives).
- [] Analyze specific instances where the model failed to make accurate predictions.
- [] Provide insights into potential improvements or areas for further investigation.

Making the Model Accessible for Operations
[] **Propose how the developed model can be integrated into daily work:**
- [] Design a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the model.
- [] Outline the steps for incorporating the model into the workflow of doctors.
- [] Consider user-friendly features to enhance the acceptance and usability of the model.
